# [Motio](http://darsa.in/motio)

Small JavaScript library for simple but powerful sprite based animations and panning.

Motio takes an element and animates its background position to create an animation effect. All is super optimized for
speed and chained to the requestAnimationFrame, with a polyfill for older browsers without it.

That being said, animating the element background is not the fastest possible way how to do this (canvas solutions are
a lot faster), but it is sure as hell the most simple one, and compatible with everything from IE6 and up.

#### Dependencies

Motio has no dependencies, but there is an optional
[Motio jQuery plugin extension](https://raw.github.com/Darsain/motio/master/dist/jquery.motio.min.js) available.

#### Compatibility

Works everywhere.
